# titanic-modeling
In this notebook, I dive into Kaggle's classic Titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal is to predict who is most likely to survive the ship's infamous crash. Given general passenger data (name, class status, fare amount, etc.), I create two Logisitic Regression models and two SVC models. With the help of GridSearchCV, I was able to attain 77.5% accuracy.
